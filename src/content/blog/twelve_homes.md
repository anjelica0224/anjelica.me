Reckless, restless  
these four walls that have consumed me, throughout  
the threads of my own chaotic wreckages, i've been bound to 
my whole life, it's like being whelved inside the creases of the ocean bed  
stuck between the high waves and the collosal emptiness 
the disheveled psyche of a maniac no less different than the rest   
always trying to dissolve inside the cracks of a broken mirror  
forged by the dysphoric swevens running wildly across   
across my head, that's like a maze up there.    


***she had grown distant from the very world she was born into***

i look at the sky, which rarely ever gives me a glimpse of the stars.   
***a different place, a different sky, a different me perhaps. but the same gnawing question that's rooted within my insides.***  
what feels like home?   
being trapped in all kinds of places, stuck with the same kind of thoughts  
the canvas i keep painting for myself - devoid of any color     
devoid of any "spark"   
keep counting houses, but none of them ever felt like home  
and the same question that creeps in yet again,     
what feels like home?   


the deliberate smile, once in a while   
the occasional hello, to strangers who walk by  
the want, the need to just.. be     
to just be nice, for just a while       
not to yourself but to the mundane world    
that surrounds you  
the trivial uncertainties floating around   
the rhapsodic waves that never drown you    
the infinite space between "them" and you   
between "her" and you   
between "him" and you   
the monotonous words that run wildly    
across the maze up in your head
that make absolutely no sense ~just take up space~      
what feels like home?   
nothing, maybe?     
nobody, perhaps?    
~certainly not some place~
you're stuck in a delusional universe   
you think is surrounded by stars but there's no one around  
to pull you out of your black hole  
it's like you're blindfolded    
~and you like it that way or so it seems~   
the cracks in your hands    
the disheveled wreckage in your brain   
the paradigm of "the edge of seventeen" 
and your despicable attempts to be unseen.
