what if my head is a dystopic painting of the usual blacks and grays    
i try to pick up the brush but my fingers shake     
fumbling over words, the fading space and all the in-betweens,  
tumbling over the stones i left unturned.   
Am i too pretentious or just too messed up  
Like a mesh of untied wires dangling at every end   
This heavy feeling, as if I'm trapped within the cage of uncertainties  
haunted by the whispers of what i'll never be.

> I'll tell you about it if I ever get it straight in my head.

hope is a heartache you say, but those eyes 
so aloof and so indifferent, on the surface     
those eyes that burn with such desire when they look up at the sky  
you're like a train wreck, a complete mess of words     
chasing the stars in your dreams, sitting on the meteoroids     
walking down the hallways with the music screaming within your chaotic insides.     
You look at the scars painted across your body      
The relentless red dripping down, right across the broken cracks    
dreaming about folks and traits lost in your memory     
You're screaming color, but you're blindfolded  
by the fabricated world you spent years weaving around yourself.    
You swallowed your share of shadows     
All your words tinged with blue     
Bottled up emotions, darting down the zenith of emptiness   
you wished you never knew.
