i'm afraid i'll never fit into the framed silhoutte of the false paragons you desire  
i'm so fucked in the head can't you see   
i'm not her, the epitome of perfection  
i bleed words not sweat, i bleed tears not smiles   
which often turn into 
stifled screams you'll never hear   
wouldnt want to be another scathing mad woman from the folklore   
the tales of a paradox, the paradigms of the edge of madness  
that i almost always slip into.   
i felt good about you till my words turned into smoke   
and you were just a fragment of my spec, a delusion of home   
who'll walk away, leaving a trail across my heart   
after you've touched every part of me   
that i wont seem to want somebody else    
to stain the marks you leave across my skin.     
i'm made of glass but do you ever see through   
the creases of the sheets of my unmade bed  
the red trickling down the mirror, to the overflowing sink  
of the bridges i burnt that led me to you, the poisoned waters i was drowning in  
i'm made of glass but do you ever care to see through   
i'm not fragile, i won't break apart  
but when you try to fix the cracks with pieces of yourself   
as if you're trying to add me to your trophies on the top shelf     
what if i trip over the edge, and the pieces fall apart   
would you pick me up, build me back again from the start    
or I'd be just another collateral damage and you'll get me replaced   
with another glass frame that fits your taste?
