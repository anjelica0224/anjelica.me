There was a creaking in her attic   
The kind that settles in your bones 
Your eyes glared into my world, the stardust that shines on the floor   
You stepped in and  
The air you breathe filled my lungs     
the flames you burnt crawled up my skin     
the ashes of my self left behind as you took to me places I've never been   
But the creaking in her attic, settled in your bones    
The words you throw across both the sides stringed so close     
You whispered against my neck I'm all you think about   
You touched me with an intensity that I almost passed out   
Its funny how you ask her to moon it off, I thought the moon was only ours to hold  
But You're the best.    
I tell you that, as the thought of your lips against my hand calms down the wrecking storms in my head      
I tell you you're the best.     
the best thing that's ever happened to me   
You say the same to her     
In a different context ofcourse, because friends is all you'll ever be.     
You see the bleeding raw shadow of me, cuz you peeled off the layers of pretense    
For a girl who hates every display of affection, you somehow managed to unravel the strings     
introducing me to the self i never knew     
I could never be this way with anyone but you   
But i watch you fix the creaking in her attic with words that i assumed only lived between us two.
