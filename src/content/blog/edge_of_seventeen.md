The crumpled bedsheet, the not so warm blanket  
In a room that screams at you   
With silent whines  
Leaking into your chest 
Of the empty walls, like your empty insides 
Screaming with an undeafening rage  
caught up in the suspension of time 
The days just melt together 
muddling into a whirlwind of the incessant noise    
Wrapped up in your mess,the wrecks of demise    
head feels heavy and hollow at the same time    
The heavens had you arche over the edge of  
One attached to 
The symbol of perfection    
forging the museum of a subtle paralyzing destruction   
And now you're wondering if you're back to square one   
And if you're walking on a fine line    
Again?

Eighteen.       
I don't wanna get older.    
What a terrifying thing it is, to have the reigns of your life entirely to yourself.    
What if you stumble, trip over and mess up?
