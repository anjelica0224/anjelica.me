I've got words to say that i never do  
The ends of my sweater i tend to pull forward, just enough so they hide my tiny wrists and fragile hands, and long fingers that are absolutely exhausted of  
exhausted of having to ruin my invisible mascara everytime the knives attack my walls.

I'd wear my heart on my sleeve just so you'd hold my arm  
Pen down every thought of you, bind those pages to the arteries of my heart  
I'd turn back time to pull down every wall that stood, to trace maps across your skin, fit into the cracks you think are so doomed  
Burn my eyes if the warmth meant something to you, memorize the sound of your fingers as they type  
The texture of your hand as it brushes mine, the ways your eyes crinkle with every smile  
Memorize every fraction of your being that makes you whole  
trailing whispers to spell the urge of burying myself into the depths of your soul   
Hated the braids of forever, but now my hair are loosely tied  
You've touched every part of me, even the ones I despise,  
And now I dont seem to want somebody else,  
to stain the marks you left across my skin,  
the trails you left across my scars,  
But I guess that's all.
